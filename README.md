# Bankruptcy-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-Python
dataset of companies across several industries and their different financial ratios from the period of 1980 â€“ 2001 to determine the risk of bankruptcy
Gathered financial data from various text files on Big Data Platform Hortonworks Ambari and consolidated the data using HiveQL
Conducted initial pre-processing on the data using Pig Script and split the data into train and test set to export as CSV files 
Conducted Exploratory data analysis in Python to identify patterns or trends which could be helpful in cleaning the data and getting insights 
Manipulated the data to handle missing values, outliers and transform the skewness in data to avoid bias in the model
Utilized Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine to build the classification model to Predict Bankruptcy.
Tested Neural Networks to be our final model with Accuracy was 78.21% and Misclassification rate to be 0.2178
